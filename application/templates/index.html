    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>The application conducts a sensitivity check on a data point to see how to reverse the classification of that point by tweaking the features.<br>
    For a data point that is originally classified as the good class, the feature tweaking will serve as a reminder that we donâ€™t want that feature to change that much; <br>
    and for a data point that is originally classified as the bad class, the feature tweaking will serve as an action item which we can use to make it good.
    
    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    You need to upload a CSV file containing two rows, the first row is the feature names, the second row is the feature values (note that label should not be included).<br><br>

    Next, you need to type in your preference of the numbers of steps you want the application to conduct the sensitivity check. Each step is a 5% change on the data.<br>
    For example, if the feature is 5, and you set the number of steps to be 20, then the feature will be tweaked between [0, 10] to see how much tweaking is needed to reverse the classification.<br>
    If the reversal fails in that range, we will tell you that it fails and you may want to change the number of steps you want to try.<br><br>

    Lastly, you will need to enter the label names representing label 0 and label 1 respectively to document the result.<br>

    <h2>Most Important Features</h2>
    <p>The percentages are relative feature importance determined by SHAP values. </p>
    <p>They represent the relative impact of each feature in the local prediction given by the classification model.</p> 
    <p>So if the feature importance is 50%, then this feature contributed to nearly half in changing the prediction probability compared to other features.</p>
